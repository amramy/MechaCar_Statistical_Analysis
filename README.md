# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview: 
Review porduction data for insights that may help AutosRUs' manufactureing team with production troubles that are blocking progress on the newest prototype "The MechaCar".

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
   When comparing the p-value to the significance level of 0.05 the Vechicle_length with P-value of 2.60e-12 and ground_clearance with P-value of 5.21e-08 are both below the significance level therefor have non-random amounts of variance in the dataset to reject the null hypothesis for these two categories. 
   The remaining categies vechicle_weight, spoiler angle, and AWD were above the significance level which means they have a random amount of variance. 
   
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
