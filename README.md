# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview: 
Review porduction data for insights that may help AutosRUs' manufactureing team with production troubles that are blocking progress on the newest prototype "The MechaCar".

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
   As the significance value we are using is 0.05 the Vechicle_length with p
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
